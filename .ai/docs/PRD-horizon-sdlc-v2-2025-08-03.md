# Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

### Title
Horizon SDLC v2 - Development Environment Bootstrapper

### Description
An enhanced OpenCode container that includes intelligent project detection and auto-initialization capabilities to automate one-time project setup and provide ongoing AI development assistance. The OpenCode container automatically detects missing project structure elements (.ai directory with standards, .github directory with workflows, docker-compose.yml, and .env files) and creates them with pre-configured content. It acts as both the smart project bootstrapper AND the AI development assistant, eliminating manual setup while preserving existing project configurations.

### Business Objective
Eliminate manual project setup overhead and provide consistent, AI-assisted development environments across all development projects through the OpenCode container's integrated bootstrapping capabilities and standardized tooling deployment.

### Target Users
- Software Development Teams
- DevOps Engineers
- Technical Architects
- Individual Developers
- Project Managers

### Value Proposition
Transforms hours of manual project setup into a single start-opencode.sh execution that intelligently detects missing project components and automatically creates them, providing immediate access to AI-assisted development environments with pre-configured standards and automation workflows - all from within the same container that provides ongoing development assistance.
