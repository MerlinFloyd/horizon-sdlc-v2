# Product Requirements Document - Horizon SDLC v2

## Project Overview

### Title
Horizon SDLC v2 - Development Environment Bootstrapper

### Description
Enhanced OpenCode container with intelligent project detection and auto-initialization capabilities. Automatically detects missing project structure (.ai directory, .github workflows, docker-compose.yml, .env files) and creates them with pre-configured content. Acts as both smart project bootstrapper AND AI development assistant.

### Business Objective
Eliminate manual project setup overhead and provide consistent, AI-assisted development environments through OpenCode container's integrated bootstrapping capabilities.

### Target Users
- Software Development Teams
- DevOps Engineers  
- Technical Architects
- Individual Developers
- Project Managers

### Value Proposition
Transforms hours of manual setup into single start-opencode.sh execution with intelligent detection and automatic creation of missing components, providing immediate AI-assisted development environments.
