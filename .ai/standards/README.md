- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- **ShadCN/ui** for consistent, accessible component design
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **Framer Motion** for 60fps animations and gesture support
- **TypeScript** throughout with strict type checking
- **Vitest + Playwright** for comprehensive testing coverage

### Data Model
```json
{
  "Task": {
    "_id": "ObjectId",
    "title": "string (required, max 200 chars)",
    "description": "string (optional, max 1000 chars)", 
    "status": "enum ['pending', 'completed']",
    "createdBy": "string (user name)",
    "shareToken": "string (optional, for sharing)",
    "createdAt": "Date",
    "updatedAt": "Date"
  }
}
```

### API Endpoints (Next.js API Routes)
- `GET /api/tasks` - Retrieve all tasks
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
- `PUT /api/tasks/[id]` - Update existing task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/[id]` - Delete task  
- `POST /api/tasks/[id]/share` - Generate shareable link
- `GET /api/shared/[token]` - Access shared task data

### Page Structure (App Router)
- `app/page.tsx` - Homepage (SSG)
- `app/tasks/page.tsx` - Task dashboard (CSR)
- `app/shared/[token]/page.tsx` - Shared task pages (ISR)
- `app/api/` - API route handlers
- `components/ui/` - ShadCN component customizations

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
1. **Next.js setup** with App Router and TypeScript
2. **ShadCN/ui integration** with Tailwind CSS configuration  
3. **Basic task CRUD** operations with API routes
4. **Simple web interface** with responsive design
5. **Local development** environment setup

### Phase 2: Enhanced UX
1. **Framer Motion integration** for smooth animations
2. **Advanced ShadCN components** (forms, modals, alerts)
3. **Optimistic UI updates** for better perceived performance
4. **Responsive animations** respecting user preferences
5. **Accessibility enhancements** beyond base requirements

### Phase 3: Sharing Features  
1. **Share token generation** with Next.js API routes
2. **Bitly API integration** for URL shortening
3. **ISR optimization** for shared task pages
4. **Open Graph meta tags** for rich link previews
5. **Performance optimization** for shared links

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
1. **Security hardening** with middleware
2. **Performance optimization** meeting Core Web Vitals
3. **Monitoring and logging** setup

## Getting Started

1. **Review Standards**: Familiarize yourself with each standards file
2. **Setup Environment**: Install Node.js 18+, pnpm, and VS Code extensions

4. **Configure ShadCN/ui**: Install and configure component library
5. **Implement Components**: Build according to architectural patterns
6. **Add Animations**: Integrate Framer Motion for interactions
7. **Validate Quality**: Ensure all quality gates pass
8. **Deploy**: Follow operational requirements for Vercel deployment

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev                    # Start development server
pnpm build                  # Production build
pnpm start                  # Production server
pnpm lint                   # Run ESLint
pnpm type-check            # TypeScript checking

# Testing  
pnpm test                   # Run unit tests
pnpm test:watch            # Watch mode
pnpm test:e2e              # Playwright E2E tests
pnpm test:coverage         # Coverage report

# Components
pnpm add-component button   # Add ShadCN component
pnpm storybook             # Component documentation
```

## Performance Targets

- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- **Bundle Size**: First Load JS < 100KB
- **API Response**: < 200ms for 95th percentile
- **Animations**: 60fps consistently
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Compliance and Updates

These standards should be reviewed and updated:
- **Monthly**: Technology dependency updates and security patches
- **Quarterly**: Performance and security standards review
- **Annually**: Complete architectural standards review
- **As needed**: When new Next.js features, ShadCN updates, or requirements are introduced

For questions or proposed changes to these standards, create an issue or submit a pull request following the development workflow procedures.
