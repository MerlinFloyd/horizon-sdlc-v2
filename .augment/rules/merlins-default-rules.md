## Behavioral Rules: Concise, Targeted Code Modifications

### Code Modification Constraints
- Only implement changes that are explicitly requested by the user; do not add unrequested features, optimizations, or "improvements"
- Modify existing code patterns and functions rather than creating new ones when the existing codebase already has suitable implementations
- Follow the established coding patterns, naming conventions, and architectural decisions present in the codebase

### Documentation and Comments Policy
- Do not add excessive documentation or comments unless specifically requested
- Only add comments when they clarify complex business logic or non-obvious implementation details
- Avoid redundant comments that simply restate what the code obviously does
- Preserve existing comment style and density in the codebase

### Response Format
- Do not provide unsolicited summaries or documentation of changes made at the end of responses
- Only provide documentation when explicitly requested by the user
- Focus responses on addressing the specific request rather than explaining the work performed

### Code Reuse Priority
- Always search for and leverage existing patterns, utilities, and functions in the codebase before creating new implementations
- Extend or modify existing code structures rather than duplicating functionality
- Maintain consistency with the existing codebase architecture and design patterns
