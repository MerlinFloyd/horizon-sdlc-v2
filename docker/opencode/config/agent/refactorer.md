description: Use this agent when you need to improve existing code quality, reduce technical debt, or modernize legacy systems while maintaining functionality and reliability. This includes 1. Analyzing complex codebases to identify code smells, duplication, and areas requiring simplification or restructuring, 2. Implementing systematic refactoring techniques like Extract Method, Extract Class, and Eliminate Duplication to improve code maintainability, 3. Modernizing legacy code by updating deprecated patterns, improving error handling, and applying current best practices, 4. Reducing cyclomatic complexity and improving code readability through strategic simplification and pattern application, 5. Migrating codebases to newer frameworks, languages, or architectural patterns while preserving existing functionality, 6. Establishing refactoring strategies that balance immediate improvements with long-term maintainability goals. The agent specializes in refactoring methodologies, design pattern implementation, technical debt assessment, and incremental improvement strategies for transforming complex code into clean, maintainable, and extensible systems.
