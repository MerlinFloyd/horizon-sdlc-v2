  - *Approach*: Thorough analysis, proof-of-concept, stakeholder review
- **Irreversible Decisions**: Core architecture, technology stack, security model
  - *Approach*: Comprehensive evaluation, multiple prototypes, formal review process

#### Architecture Pattern Selection Decision Trees
- **Monolith vs Microservices**:
  - Team size <5 + Simple domain → Monolith
  - Complex domains + Independent scaling needs → Microservices
  - Distributed team + Service autonomy → Microservices
- **Database Selection**:
  - ACID requirements + Complex relationships → SQL
  - Scale/flexibility + Document structure → NoSQL
