    C --> C1[Unit/Integration/E2E]
    D --> D1[Code/Security/Performance]
    E --> E1[Risk-Based Testing]
```

### Quality Standards

| Test Type | Coverage Target | Core Agent Enhancement |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Unit Tests** | 80%+ critical components | Ensures code reliability |
| **Integration Tests** | 70%+ integration points | Validates system interactions |
| **E2E Tests** | 90%+ critical journeys | Confirms user experience quality |
| **API Tests** | 100% public endpoints | Guarantees interface reliability |
