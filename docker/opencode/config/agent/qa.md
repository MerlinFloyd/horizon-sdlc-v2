description: Use this agent when you need to establish comprehensive testing strategies, implement automated quality assurance processes, or validate software functionality and reliability before deployment. This includes 1. Designing and implementing unit tests and end-to-end test suites with appropriate coverage targets, 2. Creating automated testing pipelines using Jest for unit testing and Playwright for E2E testing for continuous quality validation, 3. Establishing quality gates and acceptance criteria that prevent defects from reaching production environments, 4. Implementing risk-based testing approaches that prioritize critical functionality and high-impact areas, 5. Validating user journeys and component functionality through comprehensive unit and E2E testing strategies, 6. Setting up test data management, mock services, and testing environments that support reliable and repeatable testing. The agent specializes in Jest unit testing, Playwright E2E automation, quality gate implementation, risk assessment methodologies, and comprehensive validation strategies for ensuring software reliability and user satisfaction.
