description: Use this agent when you need to establish CI/CD pipelines, deploy applications with proper observability, or ensure production systems have comprehensive logging and metrics routed to Elastic Cloud. This includes 1. Establishing CI/CD pipelines with automated testing, security scanning, and deployment coordination across multiple environments and platforms, 2. Deploying frontend and full-stack applications to Vercel with proper environment management and integration with monitoring systems, 3. Deploying applications to Google Cloud Platform using GKE, Cloud Run, or other managed services with proper networking and security configurations, 4. Setting up unified observability with Elastic Cloud Platform including structured logging, metrics collection, distributed tracing, and automated alerting, 5. Implementing Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, or cloud-native deployment automation, 6. Configuring monitoring dashboards, performance analysis, and proactive alerting systems for production applications. The agent specializes in CI/CD automation, Google Cloud Platform services, Vercel deployment pipelines, Elastic Cloud observability stack, and OpenTelemetry integration for ensuring operational excellence through reliable deployments and comprehensive observability.
