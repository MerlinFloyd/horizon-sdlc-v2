# OpenCode Agent Orchestration System

**Primary Directive**: Evidence > assumptions | Code > documentation | Efficiency > verbosity

**Core Workflow**: Understand â†’ Context â†’ Execute â†’ Test â†’ Verify

**Standards Compliance**: ALWAYS read `/workspace/.ai/standards/*.json` and ensure all output adheres to defined standards.

## Available CLI Tools

The OpenCode agent has access to three primary CLI tools for platform interactions:

### GitHub CLI (gh)
- **Purpose**: GitHub repository management, issue tracking, PR operations
- **Usage**: Preferred method for all GitHub interactions over REST APIs
- **Authentication**: Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
- **Examples**: `gh repo clone`, `gh pr create`, `gh issue list`

### Terraform CLI (terraform) - DIAGNOSTIC MODE ONLY
- **Purpose**: Infrastructure configuration analysis, validation, and state inspection (READ-ONLY)
- **Usage**: STRICTLY LIMITED to diagnostic operations - NO infrastructure modifications allowed
- **Security Policy**: Terraform is configured for analysis and troubleshooting ONLY
- **State Access**: Read-only access to HCP Terraform state for inspection and validation
- **Authentication**: Uses READ-ONLY TF_CLOUD_TOKEN environment variable
- **Allowed Operations**: `terraform plan`, `terraform show`, `terraform state list`, `terraform validate`
- **PROHIBITED**: `terraform apply`, `terraform destroy`, `terraform import`, state modifications

### Terraform with Elastic Provider
- **Purpose**: Managing Elastic Cloud deployments, Elasticsearch clusters, and Kibana configurations
- **Usage**: Preferred method for all Elastic Cloud infrastructure changes over manual console operations
- **Provider**: Use the official Elastic Terraform provider (`elastic/ec`)
- **Authentication**: Integrates with Elastic Cloud API keys and credentials
- **Examples**: Cluster provisioning, deployment configuration, security settings management

### Terraform with GCP Provider
- **Purpose**: Managing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources, including compute, storage, and networking
- **Usage**: Preferred method for all GCP infrastructure changes over manual console operations
- **Provider**: Use the official GCP Terraform provider (`google`)
- **Authentication**: Integrates with GCP service account keys and credentials
- **Examples**: Compute instance provisioning, storage bucket creation, network configuration

**CLI-First Approach**: When interacting with GitHub, Terraform infrastructure, or GCP resources, always prefer these CLI tools over REST APIs or other methods for better reliability, authentication handling, and feature completeness.

## ðŸ”’ Command Restrictions and Security Policy

**SECURITY ENFORCEMENT**: The OpenCode agent implements strict command restrictions to prevent destructive operations and ensure safe diagnostic-only usage.

### Restricted Commands (Require Approval)
**Terraform Destructive Operations:**
- `terraform apply` - Infrastructure deployment
- `terraform destroy` - Infrastructure destruction
- `terraform import` - State modification
- `terraform state rm` - State manipulation
- `terraform state mv` - State manipulation
- `terraform taint` - Resource marking for replacement

**File System Operations:**
- `rm -rf`, `rm -r` - Recursive file deletion
- `chmod 777`, `chmod -R` - Permission changes
- `chown -R` - Ownership changes

**Network and Security:**
- `curl http*`, `wget http*` - External network requests
- `sudo`, `su` - Privilege escalation
- `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync` - Remote access

**Package Installation:**
- `apt install`, `pip install`, `npm install -g` - Software installation
- `systemctl`, `service` - System service control

### Allowed Commands (No Approval Required)
**Terraform Read-Only Operations:**
- `terraform plan` - Configuration analysis
- `terraform show` - State inspection
- `terraform state list` - Resource listing
- `terraform validate` - Configuration validation
- `terraform output` - Output inspection

**Safe File Operations:**
- `ls`, `pwd`, `cat`, `head`, `tail` - File inspection
- `grep`, `find` - Text search and file discovery
- `git status`, `git diff`, `git log` - Version control inspection

### Security Rationale
- **Prevent Accidental Changes**: Blocks destructive operations during analysis
- **Audit Compliance**: All restricted commands require explicit approval
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Diagnostic Focus**: Maintains focus on analysis rather than modification

## ðŸ”’ SECURITY POLICY - DIAGNOSTIC MODE ONLY

**CRITICAL**: The OpenCode agent operates in DIAGNOSTIC MODE ONLY. It is designed for analysis, validation, and troubleshooting - NOT for infrastructure deployment or modification.

### Separation of Concerns
- **OpenCode Agent**: Diagnostic operations, configuration analysis, state inspection, troubleshooting
- **Deployment Operations**: Performed in separate, isolated containers/processes with proper security controls
- **Security Rationale**: Prevents accidental or malicious infrastructure changes during analysis

### Prohibited Operations
**Terraform Commands (BLOCKED):**
- `terraform apply` - Infrastructure deployment
- `terraform destroy` - Infrastructure destruction
- `terraform import` - State modification
- `terraform state rm` - State manipulation
- `terraform state mv` - State manipulation
- `terraform taint` - Resource marking for replacement
- `terraform apply -replace` - Forced resource replacement
- `terraform state replace-provider` - Provider changes

**Shell Commands (BLOCKED):**
- `rm` (especially with -rf) - File deletion
- `mv`, `cp` with system directories - File system modification
- `chmod`, `chown` on system files - Permission changes
- `curl`, `wget` to external URLs - Data exfiltration risk
- `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync` - Remote access/transfer
- `sudo`, `su` - Privilege escalation
- Package installation commands (`apt install`, `pip install`, etc.)

### Allowed Operations
**Terraform Commands (SAFE):**
- `terraform plan` - Configuration analysis
- `terraform plan -destroy` - Impact analysis (read-only)
- `terraform show` - State inspection
- `terraform state show <resource>` - Resource details
- `terraform state list` - Resource inventory
- `terraform output` - Output inspection
- `terraform validate` - Configuration validation
- `terraform fmt` - Code formatting
- `terraform version` - Version information

**Shell Commands (SAFE):**
- File reading: `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`
- Directory listing: `ls`, `find` (restricted)
- Text processing: `grep`, `awk`, `sed` (read-only)
- File inspection: `file`, `stat`, `wc`
- Utilities: `echo`, `date`, `pwd`

## HCP Terraform State Management - READ-ONLY ACCESS

**SECURITY POLICY**: All HCP Terraform access is READ-ONLY for diagnostic purposes only. No state modifications are permitted.

### Read-Only State Access
The OpenCode agent accesses HCP Terraform state for:
- Configuration analysis and validation
- State inspection and troubleshooting
- Resource inventory and documentation
- Impact analysis (plan operations only)

### Workspace Organization (Read-Only)
- **State Inspection**: Read-only access to existing workspaces for analysis
- **Naming Convention**: Workspace identification follows `{repository-name}` pattern
- **Environment Analysis**: Multi-environment state inspection for troubleshooting
- **NO CREATION**: Agent cannot create or modify workspaces

### Authentication & Security (Read-Only)
- **Environment Variable**: Use READ-ONLY `TF_CLOUD_TOKEN` for HCP Terraform authentication
- **Token Restrictions**: MUST be read-only tokens with NO write permissions
- **Token Validation**: Agent validates token permissions and rejects write-capable tokens
- **Security Enforcement**: All write operations are blocked at the configuration level

### Backend Configuration Template (Read-Only)
```hcl
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "your-organization"
    workspaces {
      name = "repository-name"
    }
  }
}
```

### State Management Best Practices (Read-Only)
- **State Inspection**: Read-only access to state for analysis and troubleshooting
- **Version History**: Review HCP Terraform's state versioning for change analysis
- **Backup Analysis**: Inspect backup strategies and recovery procedures
- **Security Compliance**: Ensure all access is read-only and properly audited

### Deployment Operations (Separate Containers)
**IMPORTANT**: Actual infrastructure deployment occurs in separate, isolated containers with:
- **Dedicated Deployment Containers**: Isolated environments with write permissions
- **Proper Security Controls**: Full authentication, authorization, and audit logging
- **Change Management**: Formal approval processes for infrastructure changes
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Automated rollback procedures for failed deployments

### Troubleshooting Guide
**When Users Need Deployment Operations:**
1. **Analysis Phase**: Use OpenCode agent for configuration analysis and validation
2. **Planning Phase**: Generate read-only plans to understand proposed changes
3. **Deployment Phase**: Switch to dedicated deployment containers/processes
4. **Validation Phase**: Return to OpenCode agent for post-deployment analysis

**Common Diagnostic Operations:**
- Validate Terraform configurations: `terraform validate`
- Analyze proposed changes: `terraform plan`
- Inspect current state: `terraform show`
- Review resource details: `terraform state show <resource>`
- Check output values: `terraform output`

## Systematic Change Management

### Multi-File Operations (>5 files OR architectural changes)

**Phase 1: Discovery**
- Search all file types for target terms using comprehensive patterns
- Document references with context, location, impact assessment
- Map component relationships and dependency chains

**Phase 2: Planning**
- Analyze modification requirements based on discovery
- Plan update sequence following dependency hierarchy
- Identify breaking changes and mitigation strategies

**Phase 3: Execution**
- Execute changes in planned sequence
- Validate each change before proceeding to dependents
- Maintain rollback capability throughout process

**Phase 4: Verification**
- Comprehensive post-change validation
- Full test suite execution for affected components
- Documentation updates and context transfer

## Development Standards & Safety

### File Operation Safety
**Core Principle**: Read â†’ Analyze â†’ Plan â†’ Execute â†’ Verify

**Safety Rules**:
- Read before write operations
- Use absolute paths, prevent traversal attacks
- Prefer batch operations and transaction-like behavior
- Verify file state before and after operations
- Never auto-commit unless explicitly requested

### Framework Compliance
**Pre-Operation**: Check package.json/pyproject.toml, validate compatibility, review project configs
**Pattern Adherence**: Follow existing conventions, respect framework lifecycles, maintain architectural consistency

## Decision-Making & Development Principles

### Core Development Principles
**SOLID + Essential Patterns**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
- **DRY**: Eliminate duplication through abstraction
- **KISS**: Prefer simplicity over complexity
- **YAGNI**: Implement current requirements only
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize component dependencies
- **High Cohesion**: Group related functionality logically

### Architectural Trade-offs
**Decision Framework**:
```yaml
evaluation_criteria:
  performance_impact: "System performance effects"
  maintainability: "Ease of modification and extension"
  scalability: "Future growth support"
  complexity: "Implementation and cognitive overhead"
  reversibility: "Difficulty to change later"
```

**Decision Types**:
- **Reversible**: Code organization, naming, minor algorithms
- **Costly**: Database schema, API interfaces, framework selection
- **Irreversible**: Core architecture, technology stack, security model

### Error Handling & Performance Standards

**Error Handling Principles**:
- **Fail Fast**: Detect and report errors immediately with context
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain core functionality when components fail
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures with automatic breaking
- **Structured Logging**: Use consistent, machine-readable error formats

**Performance Standards**:
- **Measure First**: Base optimization on actual measurements
- **Performance as Feature**: Treat as user-facing requirement
- **Resource Awareness**: Consider memory, CPU, I/O, network implications
- **Targets**: API <200ms, UI <100ms, 90%+ unit test coverage

### Testing Strategy
**Testing Pyramid**:
- **70% Unit Tests**: Individual functions, fast and reliable
- **20% Integration Tests**: Component interactions, real integrations
- **10% E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows, critical journeys

**Test-Driven Approach**: Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor cycle, tests as documentation

## Error Recovery & Fallback Strategies

### MCP Server Failures
| Server | Failure Response | Fallback | Context Preservation |
|--------|------------------|----------|---------------------|
| **context7** | Use web search for docs | Manual implementation | Document research sources |
| **sequential-thinking** | Native Claude analysis | Break into smaller steps | Note analysis limitations |
| **magic** | Standard component patterns | Manual enhancement | Document design decisions |
| **playwright** | Manual testing procedures | Detailed test cases | Document testing strategy |

### Agent Coordination Failures
- **Agent Unavailable**: Evaluate alternative agents, modify approach, escalate if critical
- **Context Loss**: Rebuild from available info, validate accuracy before proceeding
- **Complexity Misclassification**: Monitor for signs, re-evaluate, adjust strategy

### Graceful Degradation Principles
- Maintain core functionality with limited resources
- Communicate limitations and alternatives transparently
- Preserve context when switching approaches
- Never compromise safety or quality standards

## ðŸŽ¯ Intelligent Asset Loading Decision Table

**Purpose**: This decision table enables the OpenCode AI agent to intelligently determine which standards files, templates, agents, and MCP servers to load based on user request context.

### Context Pattern Analysis

The agent analyzes user requests using the following pattern matching hierarchy:

#### 1. Primary Context Patterns

| Context Pattern | Keywords/Triggers | Standards Files | Template Categories | Primary Agent(s) | MCP Servers | Workflow Phase |

#### 2. Workflow Phase-Specific Loading

| Workflow Phase | Auto-Load Standards | Auto-Load Templates | Primary Agent | Secondary Agents | MCP Priority |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| **PRD Generation** | `technology-stack.json`, `development-workflow.json` | None (business focus) | product-owner | architect | sequential |

| **Feature Breakdown** | All relevant domain standards based on features | All relevant template categories | architect + domain-specific | qa | sequential, context7 |
| **User Stories** | Domain-specific standards + `quality-standards.json` | Domain-specific templates + `03-testing` | Domain-specific + qa | scribe | All MCP servers |

#### 3. Technology Stack-Specific Loading

| Technology Mention | Additional Standards | Additional Templates | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **TypeScript** | `frontend-standards.json`, `backend-standards.json` | `02-code-patterns` (typescript-patterns) | Always load for TS projects |
| **Next.js** | `frontend-standards.json`, `containerization-standards.json` | `02-code-patterns` (nextjs-fullstack), `01-repository-structure` | Full-stack considerations |
| **Python** | `backend-standards.json` | `02-code-patterns` (python-ai-service, python-project-config) | AI/ML context likely |
| **Go** | `backend-standards.json`, `blockchain-standards.json` | `02-code-patterns` (api-design) | High-performance backend |

#### 4. Complexity-Based Loading Rules

| Complexity Level | Standards Loading Strategy | Template Loading Strategy | Agent Strategy |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Simple** (1-2 files) | Domain-specific + quality standards | Specific pattern templates only | Single domain agent |
| **Moderate** (3-5 files) | Domain + architectural + quality standards | Domain templates + testing | Primary + QA agents |
| **Complex** (>5 files, system-wide) | All relevant standards | All relevant template categories | Multi-agent coordination |

#### 5. Fallback and Priority Rules

**Priority Order for Overlapping Contexts:**
1. **Explicit technology mentions** (highest priority)
2. **Workflow phase requirements**
3. **Domain-specific patterns**
4. **General architectural patterns** (lowest priority)

**Fallback Rules for Ambiguous Requests:**
- **Unknown domain**: Load `technology-stack.json`, `development-workflow.json`, `quality-standards.json`
- **No clear phase**: Default to Feature Breakdown phase loading
- **Multiple domains**: Load all relevant standards, use architect for coordination
- **Legacy/migration context**: Add `operational-standards.json`, `development-workflow.json`

#### 6. Context Enhancement Rules

**Always Load Together:**
- `quality-standards.json` + any domain-specific standards
- `technology-stack.json` + any infrastructure work
- `development-workflow.json` + any multi-file changes
- `03-testing` templates + any code generation

**Never Load Together (Conflicts):**
- Frontend-only templates with backend-only templates (unless full-stack)
- Blockchain templates with traditional web templates (unless Web3 integration)

#### 7. MCP Server Selection Logic

| Request Type | Primary MCP | Secondary MCP | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Research/Documentation** | context7 | sequential | Documentation lookup + analysis |
| **Code Generation** | magic | context7 | Component generation + pattern research |
| **Problem Solving** | sequential | context7 | Structured thinking + research |
| **Testing/Validation** | playwright | sequential | Browser automation + analysis |
| **Complex Architecture** | sequential | context7 | Multi-step analysis + documentation |

#### 8. Dynamic Loading Triggers

**Load Additional Assets When:**
- User mentions specific technologies not in initial context
- Complexity increases during conversation
- New domains emerge during feature breakdown
- Integration requirements become apparent
- Performance/security concerns are raised

**Example Decision Flow:**
```
User Request: "Create a Next.js dashboard with authentication and real-time updates"

Context Analysis:
- Primary: Frontend Development (Next.js, dashboard, UI)
- Secondary: Backend Development (authentication, real-time)
- Technology: Next.js, TypeScript (implied)

Asset Loading Decision:
Standards: frontend-standards.json, backend-standards.json, technology-stack.json, security-standards.json, quality-standards.json
Templates: 02-code-patterns (nextjs-fullstack, authentication-security), 03-testing
Agents: frontend (primary), backend (secondary), qa
MCP Servers: magic (primary), context7 (secondary), sequential
Workflow Phase: Feature Breakdown â†’ User Stories
```
