# Extracted Content from AGENTS.md Condensation

## Content Removed During Condensation

### 1. Detailed MCP Server Configurations
**Extracted**: Extensive workflow processes for each MCP server (Context7, Sequential-Thinking, Magic MCP, Playwright)
**Reason**: Agent-specific implementation details
**Recommendation**: Move to individual agent files or MCP server documentation

### 2. Comprehensive Decision-Making Frameworks
**Extracted**: 
- Detailed SOLID principles with validation questions
- Extensive performance evaluation criteria
- Complete observability implementation standards
- Comprehensive testing decision frameworks
- Technology evaluation matrices
- Architecture pattern selection details

**Reason**: While valuable, these are implementation details rather than orchestration logic
**Recommendation**: Create separate reference documents or integrate into agent-specific files

### 3. Claude-Specific Optimization Guidelines
**Extracted**: 
- Pattern recognition excellence details
- Systematic thinking capabilities
- Contextual analysis frameworks
- Optimization for Claude limitations
- Execution optimization strategies

**Reason**: Meta-guidance about Claude usage rather than operational orchestration
**Recommendation**: Move to separate Claude optimization guide

### 4. Extensive Error Handling Patterns
**Extracted**:
- Detailed error classification trees
- Comprehensive error response patterns
- Extensive logging frameworks
- Complex error communication standards

**Reason**: Implementation details that should be in coding standards
**Recommendation**: Move to development standards documentation

### 5. Operational Excellence Framework
**Extracted**:
- Detailed workflow optimization processes
- Comprehensive quality assurance integration
- Extensive stakeholder balance considerations

**Reason**: Process details rather than agent orchestration
**Recommendation**: Move to project management or development process documentation
