- **Agent Modes**: PRD, Architecture, Feature Breakdown, USP generation
- **MCP Integration**: Context7, GitHub MCP, Sequential Thinking usage patterns

### 3. Key Technical Insights

#### 3.1 Secrets Management Strategy
**GitHub Secrets Required**:
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: AI provider authentication
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Build scripts accept API keys as command-line parameters
- Environment variable substitution: `{env:VARIABLE_NAME}`
- .gitignore excludes `.ai/config/auth.json`
- GitHub Actions inject secrets securely

#### 3.2 Container Architecture
**Volume Mounting Strategy**:
```bash
docker run -d \
  -v ${PROJECT_ROOT}:/workspace \
  -v ${PROJECT_ROOT}/.opencode:/.opencode \
  -v ${PROJECT_ROOT}/.ai:/.ai \
  -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=${OPENROUTER_API_KEY} \
  opencode:latest
```

**Asset Management**:
- `.opencode/`: OpenCode's data and configuration
- `.ai/`: User-modifiable templates, standards, prompts
- Real-time updates via volume mounts

#### 3.3 GitHub Actions Integration
**Required Workflow** (`.github/workflows/opencode.yml`):
```yaml
name: opencode
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  opencode:
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '/oc') || contains(github.event.comment.body, '/opencode')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: sst/opencode/github@latest
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

### 4. Implementation Roadmap

#### 4.1 Critical Path (8 weeks)
1. **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation setup and asset creation
2. **Weeks 3-4**: Core engine and Docker integration
3. **Weeks 5-6**: GitHub integration and testing
4. **Weeks 7-8**: Distribution and documentation

#### 4.2 Validation Strategy
**Phase Gates**:
- Phase 1: CLI functional, basic operations work
- Phase 2: Templates generate valid projects
- Phase 3: Complete project generation works
- Phase 4: OpenCode deploys and responds
- Phase 5: GitHub integration functional
- Phase 6: All tests pass, cross-platform verified
- Phase 7: Release package complete

#### 4.3 Success Criteria
**Functional Success**:
- Single command creates fully configured development environment
- OpenCode container operational with all MCP servers functional
- Seamless handoff from bootstrapper to OpenCode
- GitHub Actions integration works reliably

**Technical Success**:
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Performance: Complete setup in under 5 minutes
- Reliability: 95% success rate across configurations
- Security: Proper secrets management and container security

### 5. Next Steps and Recommendations

#### 5.1 Immediate Actions Required
1. **OpenCode Container Image**: Ensure availability before Week 4
2. **GitHub Repository**: Set up with proper permissions
3. **Development Environment**: Prepare Node.js 20+, Docker, Git
4. **API Keys**: Obtain OPENROUTER_API_KEY for testing

#### 5.2 Implementation Sequence
1. **Start with Phase 1**: Project infrastructure and CLI framework
2. **Parallel Asset Creation**: Begin template development immediately
3. **Early Docker Testing**: Validate container integration early
4. **Incremental Validation**: Test each component as it's built

#### 5.3 Risk Mitigation
1. **OpenCode Dependency**: Establish clear timeline and fallback plan
2. **GitHub Integration**: Test in isolated environment first
3. **Cross-Platform**: Test on all target platforms throughout development
4. **Security**: Implement secure secret handling from the start

### 6. Documentation Structure

All technical documentation is now organized as follows:
```
docs/
├── requirements.md                    # Original requirements
├── technical-requirements.md          # Technical specifications
├── repository-structure.md            # Folder structure design
├── implementation-plan.md             # Implementation roadmap
├── standards-templates-integration.md # Standards integration
└── technical-transition-summary.md    # This summary document
```

### 7. Conclusion

The transition from requirements to technical implementation is now complete with comprehensive documentation covering:

✅ **Technical Requirements**: Detailed specifications with concrete examples
✅ **Repository Structure**: Complete folder organization and component relationships  
✅ **Implementation Plan**: 7-phase roadmap with dependencies and validation
✅ **Standards Integration**: Framework for implementing requirements.md standards

**Ready for Implementation**: All necessary technical specifications, dependencies, and validation criteria are defined. The implementation can begin immediately with Phase 1 (Foundation Setup).

**Human Interaction Points**: Clearly identified and scheduled throughout the implementation timeline, particularly around secrets management and GitHub configuration.

**Risk Mitigation**: Comprehensive strategies in place for technical, dependency, and operational risks.

The project is now ready to move from planning to active development with a clear roadmap and validation framework.
