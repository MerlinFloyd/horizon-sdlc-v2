## Next Steps

This PRD provides the foundation for technical requirements specification. The next phase should focus on:

1. **Technical Requirements Document (TRD)** creation based on these user-centered requirements
2. **User Stories** breakdown for development planning
3. **Design mockups** aligned with user journey flows
4. **Technical architecture** decisions supporting the business requirements
5. **Implementation roadmap** prioritized by user value and technical dependencies

The PRD emphasizes the core value proposition of friction-free task management with optional collaboration, providing clear guidance for technical implementation while maintaining focus on user experience quality.
