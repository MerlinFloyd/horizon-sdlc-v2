# SuperClaude Framework Reimplementation Requirements for OpenCode CLI

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive requirements for reimplementing SuperClaude Framework's sophisticated command processing pipeline using a **prompt chain architecture** in OpenCode CLI. The goal is to recreate SuperClaude's intelligent routing, auto-activation, and context-aware capabilities through a 5-stage progressive refinement system with agent-based execution.

## Project Scope

### What We're Reimplementing
- **5-Stage Prompt Chain Architecture**: Idea Definition → PRD → TRD → Feature Breakdown → User Story Execution
- **Agent-Based Persona System**: Spawnable agents with specialized capabilities and coordination
- **Intelligent Orchestration**: Multi-factor scoring for agent selection and MCP server coordination
- **Quality Gates Framework**: 8-step validation system integrated throughout the prompt chain
- **Wave Mode Complexity Assessment**: Multi-stage execution for complex development scenarios

### What We're NOT Reimplementing
- Python installation infrastructure
- Component management system
- Backup and restore functionality
- Legacy script fallback mechanisms
- Persistent memory or cross-session state management

## Key Architectural Insights

SuperClaude works as a **prompt engineering framework** that provides intelligent orchestration through progressive refinement. The new architecture replaces static modes with a dynamic prompt chain that evolves user ideas into executable implementations through stateless, context-aware processing.

- **User Story Execution**: Provides concrete implementation guidance

### **Context-Aware Processing**
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Context-driven decision making at each stage
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Prompt chain adapts to project requirements
- **Quality Assurance**: Progressive validation throughout the chain
- **Efficient Execution**: Stateless processing with intelligent routing

### **Agent-Based Specialization**
- **Targeted Expertise**: Spawns agents with specific domain knowledge
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents can work on different aspects
- **Quality Assurance**: Specialized agents for security, performance, testing
- **Coordination**: Orchestrator manages agent interactions and results

## Next Steps
